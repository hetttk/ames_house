# 🏠 House Price Prediction — Ames Housing Dataset

> **Level:** Beginner → Intermediate &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Domain:** Regression, Feature Engineering &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

A complete, well-documented feature engineering + baseline modeling pipeline built on the famous **Ames Housing Dataset**, designed to predict `SalePrice`. This project is a great hands-on exercise for practicing real-world data cleaning, feature creation, encoding strategies, outlier handling, and scaling — the core skills every ML practitioner needs before modeling.

## 🔎 Overview

This notebook takes the raw Ames Housing dataset and transforms it into a model-ready dataset through a structured feature engineering workflow, then trains and compares two baseline regression models (**Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**) to predict house sale prices.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Ames Housing Dataset (Iowa residential home sales, 2006–2010)
- **Size:** ~2,930 rows × 82 columns
- **Target Variable:** `SalePrice`

> ⚠️ Place `AmesHousing.csv` in the same folder as the notebook before running it.

## 🛠 Feature Engineering Pipeline

| Step | Technique | Applied To |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 1️⃣ Missing Values | Median (numeric) / Mode / "None" (categorical) | All columns with NaNs |
| 2️⃣ Log Transformation | `log1p` to fix right-skew | `SalePrice`, `Lot_Area` |
| 3️⃣ New Features | Derived engineered columns | `HouseAge`, `TotalBathrooms`, `TotalPorchArea` |
| 4️⃣ Ordinal Encoding | Ordered integer mapping (Po→Ex) | `Exter_Qual`, `Kitchen_Qual` |
| 5️⃣ One-Hot Encoding | `pd.get_dummies` | `Neighborhood`, `House_Style` |
| 6️⃣ Outlier Detection | Z-Score (\|z\| > 3) & IQR (1.5×IQR) | `SalePrice`, `Gr_Liv_Area`, `Lot_Area`, etc. |
| 7️⃣ Feature Scaling | `StandardScaler` | All key numeric features |

### 🧮 New Feature Formulas

```python
HouseAge        = Yr_Sold - Year_Built
TotalBathrooms  = Full_Bath + 0.5*Half_Bath + Bsmt_Full_Bath + 0.5*Bsmt_Half_Bath
TotalPorchArea  = Open_Porch_SF + Enclosed_Porch + 3Ssn_Porch + Screen_Porch + Wood_Deck_SF
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone / Download this project

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy jupyter
```

### 3. Add the dataset
Download the **Ames Housing Dataset** and place `AmesHousing.csv` in the project folder.
